**The human-AI symbiotic browser. A shared browser workspace for humans and multiple AI agents.**

Zerant Browser is a local-first Electron browser where a human and one or more AI agents browse together. Agents can connect on the same machine or remotely over Tailscale, operate inside the same real browser context, and work across tabs, workspaces, and authenticated sessions while an 8-layer security model keeps web content from attacking the agent layer.

Zerant Browser is built for the web that already exists. It does not require sites to
ship special agent integrations before a human and an AI can work together in
the same real browser.

Connect via **MCP** (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Ollama, any
MCP client) or a **300+ endpoint HTTP API**. Those are connection layers, not
the product story. The core idea is shared browser context, human oversight,
and security around real browser work.

Zerant Browser is the local-first browser layer for real human-AI collaboration, not a wrapper or an automation toy.

## What's new now

Zerant Browser now supports:

- local MCP and local HTTP access
- remote MCP over Tailscale
- remote HTTP over Tailscale
- multiple agents connected to the same browser at once
- in-product pairing and onboarding through **Settings -> Connected Agents**

## What Can An Agent Do?

| Category | Tools | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Navigation & Input** | 10 | Navigate, click, type, scroll, press keys, wait for load |
| **Tabs & Workspaces** | 13 | Open/close/focus tabs, emoji badges, create workspaces, move tabs between them |
| **Page Content** | 8 | Read page, get HTML, extract content, get links, forms, screenshots |
| **Accessibility Snapshots** | 7 | Accessibility tree with `@ref` IDs, click/fill by ref, semantic find |
| **DevTools** | 12 | Console logs, network requests, DOM queries, XPath, performance, storage |
| **Network Inspector** | 9 | Network log, API discovery, HAR export, request mocking |
| **Sessions & Auth** | 12 | Isolated sessions, session fetch relay, auth state detection |
| **Bookmarks & History** | 15 | Full bookmark CRUD, history search, site memory |
| **Passwords & Forms** | 9 | Vault management, password generation, form autofill |
| **Extensions** | 13 | List, install, import from Chrome, gallery, updates, conflicts |
| **Workflows & Tasks** | 18 | Multi-step workflows, task approval, agent autonomy, tab locks |
| **Previews** | 4 | Create live HTML pages in the browser, update with instant reload |
| **Media & UI** | 19 | Voice, audio, screenshots, draw mode, sidebar config, panel toggle |
| **Device Emulation** | 4 | Emulate phones/tablets, custom viewports |
| **Data & Config** | 16 | Export/import, downloads, watches, pinboards, browser config |
| **System** | 6 | Browser status, headless mode, Google Photos, security overrides |
| **Awareness** | 2 | Activity digest, real-time focus detection — the AI knows what you're doing |

**250 tools total** — full parity with the HTTP API.

## Why Not Just Use Playwright?

Playwright gives you a headless browser that you control. Zerant Browser gives you
the user's **real browser** — their tabs, their sessions, their cookies,
their extensions. The agent doesn't start from scratch; it joins what's
already there.

Plus:

- **Security model**: 8 layers between web content and the agent, including
  prompt injection defense. Playwright has none.
- **Shared context**: the agent sees what the human is doing and vice versa
- **Stealth**: websites see a normal Chrome browser, not an automation tool
- **Background tabs**: operate on any tab without stealing focus
- **Human-in-the-loop**: captchas, risky actions, and ambiguous cases go
  back to the human

## Zerant Browser vs WebMCP

WebMCP is an important new idea, but it solves a different layer of the stack.

| | WebMCP | Zerant Browser |
|---|---|---|
| Primary scope | Makes individual websites more agent-ready | Makes the real browser a shared workspace for humans and agents |
| Where it runs | Site/page level, via tools exposed by the site | Browser-wide, across tabs, sessions, workspaces, and existing sites |
| Adoption model | Requires site support | Works on the web as it exists today |
| Strength | Structured, site-defined actions | Shared context, authenticated sessions, security, and human handoffs |
| Best fit | Sites that want to expose cleaner agent tooling | Users and teams that want humans and agents working together in the same browser |

WebMCP helps websites become more agent-readable.
Zerant Browser helps humans and agents work together in the real browser, across the web.

These ideas can coexist. Zerant Browser is not anti-WebMCP. If more sites expose
cleaner agent surfaces, great. But Zerant Browser's job is broader: shared human-AI
browser work, local-first control, and governance around what the agent is
doing.

For the longer version, see [docs/zerant-browser-vs-webmcp.md](docs/zerant-browser-vs-webmcp.md).

## Why this matters

Most AI browser tooling still falls into one of two buckets:

- browser automation in a separate session
- AI features bolted onto a browser without true shared context

Zerant Browser takes a different path. Humans and agents work in the same real browser, with the same tabs, sessions, cookies, and visibility, plus explicit handoffs and a serious security model around that collaboration.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hydro13/zerant-browser.git
cd zerant-browser
npm install
npm start
```

macOS is the primary platform. Linux works. Windows is validated as a remote agent host.

- **Support development** -> sponsor Zerant on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hydro13)

## Connect Your AI Agent

Zerant supports AI agents running on the same machine or on a remote machine
over a private Tailscale network. Both can be active at the same time.

The primary onboarding flow is now inside Zerant itself:

1. Open **Settings -> Connected Agents**
2. Choose **On this machine** or **On another machine**
3. Let Zerant generate the connection instructions
4. Paste those instructions into your AI agent

Zerant handles the setup-code flow and publishes its own bootstrap/discovery
surface for the agent at `/agent`, `/agent/manifest`, `/agent/version`, and
`/skill`.

### On the same machine (MCP or HTTP)

If your AI runs on the same machine as Zerant, the simplest path is:

1. Open **Settings -> Connected Agents**
2. Choose **On this machine**
3. Copy the generated instructions into your AI

**MCP** — Add to your MCP client configuration (Claude Code, Claude Desktop,
Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tandem": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/zerant-browser/dist/mcp/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start Zerant, and 250 tools are available immediately.

**HTTP API** — Use the local API token directly:

```bash
TOKEN="$(cat ~/.tandem/api-token)"

curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8765/status
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8765/tabs/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

300+ endpoints for everything the MCP tools can do, plus lower-level access.

### On another machine (Tailscale)

Remote agents connect over a private Tailscale network. Both machines must be
on the same tailnet. Zerant is never exposed to the public internet.

1. Open **Settings -> Connected Agents**
2. Choose **On another machine**
3. Zerant detects the Tailscale address and generates a ready-to-use instruction block
4. Paste that instruction block into your remote AI agent
5. The AI reads `/agent`, exchanges the setup code for a permanent token, and connects

The token stays valid until you pause, revoke, or remove it from the
Connected Agents UI.

**MCP** (recommended for Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tandem": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://<tandem-tailscale-ip>:8765/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-binding-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**HTTP API** works the same way as local, using the binding token as Bearer auth.

Both transports give remote agents the same 250 tools and 300+ endpoints as local agents.

<details>
<summary>Manual pairing (for scripts or custom tooling)</summary>

```bash
# Exchange setup code for token
curl -X POST http://<tandem-tailscale-ip>:8765/pairing/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"TDM-XXXX-XXXX","machineId":"...","machineName":"...","agentLabel":"...","agentType":"..."}'

# Use the returned token
curl -sS http://<tandem-tailscale-ip>:8765/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

</details>

### Discovery

A running Zerant instance publishes its own version-matched discovery surface:

- `GET /agent` — human-readable bootstrap page
- `GET /agent/manifest` — machine-readable endpoint manifest
- `GET /skill` — version-matched usage guide

These are public (no auth required) and use the request `Host` header, so they
return correct URLs whether accessed locally or over Tailscale.

## Security Model

Zerant Browser treats security as core architecture, not an afterthought. When an AI
has access to your browser, every ad network, tracking pixel, and malicious
domain is in the agent's attack surface.

**8 security layers:**

1. Network shield with domain/IP blocklists
2. Outbound guard scanning POST bodies for credential leaks
3. AST-level JavaScript analysis on runtime scripts
4. Behavior monitoring per tab
5. Gatekeeper channel for ambiguous cases
6. Prompt injection defense on page content
7. Layer separation — pages cannot fingerprint the agent
8. Human-in-the-loop for risky or blocked actions

Strict layer separation means page JavaScript cannot observe or fingerprint
the agent layer. That's not something you bolt onto Chrome after the fact.

## The Browser

Beyond the agent layer, Zerant Browser is a full daily-driver browser:

- **Left sidebar**: Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Gmail, Calendar,
  Instagram, X — all in isolated sessions alongside your browsing
- **Workspaces**: organize tabs into separate spaces (the agent gets its own)
- **Pinboards**: collect and organize links, images, quotes
- **Bookmarks & History**: with Chrome import and sync
- **Chrome extensions**: load from disk or install from Chrome Web Store
- **URL autocomplete**: Chrome-style suggestions from browsing history
- **Password manager**: local vault with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Video recorder**: application and region capture
- **Device emulation**: test responsive designs

All local-first. No cloud dependency.

## Typical Agent Workflows

- **Research**: agent opens multiple tabs, reads and summarizes pages while
  you keep browsing
- **Autonomous workspace**: agent creates its own workspace, manages tabs
  independently, and alerts you when human help is needed
- **SPA inspection**: accessibility snapshots and semantic locators instead
  of guessing from raw HTML
- **Session-aware tasks**: agent operates inside your real authenticated
  browser context
- **Live previews**: agent builds HTML pages and shows them to you in the
  browser with instant live reload

## Status

Public **developer preview** — real project, early public state, open for
contributors, not yet a polished mass-user release.

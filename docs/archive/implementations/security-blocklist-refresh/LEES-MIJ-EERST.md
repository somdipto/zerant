# Security Blocklist Refresh — START HERE

> **Date:** 2026-03-07
> **Status:** Complete
> **Goal:** Make Zerant's blocklist pipeline faster at startup, broader in feed support, and safer to update in the background without freezing the browser
> **Order:** Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

## Why This Track Exists

Zerant's current `NetworkShield` is effective, but it still assumes a small set
or text-based feeds loaded synchronously into memory. That works for the current
three blocklists, but it does not scale well to modern threat intel formats,
larger curated feeds, or more frequent updates.

This track keeps security in the browser core while explicitly keeping consumer
ad blocking out or scope. Phishing, malware, and known bad infrastructure belong
in the core security pipeline. EasyList-style ad blocking does not.

---

## Architecture In 30 Seconds

```text
Startup
  -> SecurityDB blocklist + cached critical snapshot
  -> NetworkShield becomes usable immediately
  -> UI is ready
  -> background hydrate loads larger cached feeds
  -> background updater refreshes stale sources
  -> atomic swap replaces active in-memory sets
```

The browser should start fast, then improve its threat coverage while Robin is
already browsing.

## Hard Rules For This Track

1. **No ad blocker scope creep**: do not add EasyList, EasyPrivacy, cosmetic
   filtering, or consumer annoyance blocking to the browser core
2. **Fast startup wins**: no large synchronous blocklist parse on the critical
   startup path after this track is complete
3. **Atomic updates only**: never expose a partially loaded in-memory blocklist
   to live request decisions
4. **High-signal feeds first**: prioritize phishing, malware, and C2 feeds over
   giant tracker/ad lists
5. **Function names over line numbers**: always refer to concrete
   functions/classes

---

## In Scope

- parser support for structured feeds (`json`, `csv`)
- per-source metadata and scheduling
- cached startup snapshots for fast boot
- async/incremental background hydration
- curated security feed expansion for threat intel

## Explicitly Out Or Scope

- EasyList / EasyPrivacy / OISD as browser-core blocking
- cosmetic filtering
- DOM ad removal
- content-script ad blocking
- broad "block more stuff" behavior that mixes ads and security

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `LEES-MIJ-EERST.md` | execution guide for the full track | Ready |
| `fase-1-parser-foundation.md` | parser abstraction + source manifest | Complete |
| `fase-2-fast-start-hydration.md` | cached startup snapshot + atomic swap | Complete |
| `fase-3-tiered-update-scheduler.md` | source freshness tiers + async update policy | Complete |
| `fase-4-core-feed-expansion.md` | add curated JSON/CSV threat feeds | Complete |

## Design Decisions Already Made

- `NetworkShield` remains a security component, not an ad blocker
- existing domain and URL checks remain the core lookup path
- SecurityDB remains the durable source or blocklist metadata and dynamic
  entries
- startup should trust existing reputation/trust systems first, then improve
  blocklist coverage in the background

---

## Proposed Feed Strategy

### Startup-critical

- SecurityDB dynamic blocklist entries
- cached last-known-good critical snapshot
- existing small/high-signal sources such as URLhaus

### Background hydration

- cached structured feeds parsed off the critical path
- atomic replace or in-memory sets after the new snapshot is complete

### Recurring updates

- hourly: high-signal realtime-ish feeds
- daily: medium-change feeds
- weekly: slow-moving curated sources

## Phase Selection Rule

Future sessions should:

1. read this file
2. check the `Progress Log`
3. select the first phase in sequence whose status is not `Complete`
4. read only that phase file and its listed files

Do not start later phases early.

## Progress Log

### Phase 1 — Parser Foundation

- Status: Complete
- Date: 2026-03-07
- Commit: `beffe08d42ad3723f138716e6367e7618723374e`
- Summary: Added shared blocklist parser/source types, moved updater and `NetworkShield` onto the same source manifest, preserved the existing text-feed behavior, and added declarative JSON/CSV parser support without expanding the feed set.
- Remaining risks for next phase: Fast-start hydration must load cached snapshots without reintroducing startup stalls, and the snapshot swap must keep `blockedDomains` plus IP-origin data consistent so live request decisions never see mixed old/new blocklist state.

### Phase 2 — Fast-Start Hydration

- Status: Complete
- Date: 2026-03-07
- Commit: `27abf6feff7aace748e050bfdbe46a69f8fb166b`
- Summary: Replaced `NetworkShield`'s synchronous startup parse with a snapshot-first boot path, queued background hydration, and atomic Set swaps; wired startup hydration through `SecurityManager`; and added focused regression coverage for snapshot boot, no-clear reload behavior, cache promotion, and snapshot refresh persistence.
- Remaining risks for next phase: The tiered scheduler must prevent overlapping refresh downloads and queued hydrates from turning into repeated reload storms, especially when stale-source checks and update intervals fire near the same time.

### Phase 3 — Tiered Update Scheduler

- Status: Complete
- Date: 2026-03-07
- Commit: `528ccabb8fd05d430bbe3a6db91db3c3000bbb73`
- Summary: Replaced the single 24-hour scheduler with per-source hourly/daily/weekly freshness checks, persisted `lastUpdated` / `lastAttempted` / failure state per feed in blocklist metadata, exposed per-source freshness through the security status routes, and added focused tests for due-source selection plus route visibility.
- Remaining risks for next phase: Feed expansion must stay curated; large low-signal or ad-focused lists still do not belong in the browser core, and any new structured feeds must avoid reintroducing startup or reload stalls.

### Phase 4 — Core Feed Expansion

- Status: Complete
- Date: 2026-03-07
- Commit: `8075add06b2aaf28676a045bd099f15a2daf5811`
- Summary: Added OpenPhish plus high-confidence ThreatFox domain and URL feeds to the shared manifest, extended the structured parser layer with typed record filters and comment-prefixed CSV header support, and verified the expanded curated source set through `/security/status` without reintroducing startup stalls.
- Remaining risks after this track: PhishTank was left out because the current public dump behavior is empty/rate-limited for unattended refreshes, StevenBlack remains a legacy carryover source until a separate cleanup can safely prune old tracker entries from persisted storage, and CIDR/IP-range blocking still requires a different lookup model than domain-first `NetworkShield`.

## 1. Tab Management

### 1.1 Tab Islands
**Category:** Tab Organization
**Description:** Automatically arranges tabs into separate, customizable groups by browsing context. Tabs opened from the same origin or session are visually connected into "islands" — color-coded clusters with named handles. Users can collapse islands to save space, drag tabs between islands, and use Shift+click to select and move multiple tabs simultaneously.
**UI Location:** Tab bar (top or browser). Colored handles appear above grouped tabs.
**Visual Design:** Each island has a distinct color tag and optional custom name. Collapsed islands occupy minimal space. Tooltip preview on hover shows grouped tab thumbnails. Visual connections (subtle lines/shading) between grouped tabs.
**Keyboard Shortcut:** Alt+T (new tab in current island)
**Technical Notes:** Auto-creates islands on new browsing sessions. Works alongside Workspaces. Supports multi-tab drag-and-drop operations. Configurable via Settings > Features > User Interface > "Automatically create tab islands."
**Zerant Relevance:** **HIGH** — Core tab organization paradigm. Zerant should evaluate whether island-style grouping fits its UX model.

### 1.2 Workspaces
**Category:** Tab Organization
**Description:** Higher-level tab organization that lets users create up to 5 named workspace "buckets" (e.g., Work, Shopping, Research, Planning). Each workspace has its own set or tabs and tab islands. Switching workspaces instantly shows only that workspace's tabs; Ctrl+Tab cycles only within the current workspace.
**UI Location:** Sidebar top — customizable workspace icons. Three-dot menu at sidebar bottom opens Sidebar setup panel.
**Visual Design:** Customizable icons and names per workspace. Clean single-click switching.
**Keyboard Shortcut:** Custom hotkeys configurable per workspace. Ctrl+Tab cycles within current workspace only.
**Technical Notes:** Workspace tabs are fully isolated — actions (reload all, duplicate highlighting) apply only within current workspace. Right-click tab > "Move tab to workspace" or right-click link > "Open link in workspace."
**Zerant Relevance:** **HIGH** — Workspace isolation is a powerful organizational concept for multi-context browsing.

### 1.3 Split Screen
**Category:** Tab Management / Productivity
**Description:** View 2–4 websites simultaneously within a single tab view. Supports vertical, horizontal, and grid layouts with resizable panes. All split tabs are accessible through one shared address bar.

**Visual Design:** Vertically connected tabs with a vertical line separator. Three-dot menu in each frame. Toolbar organizes icons by function — browser-wide icons on right tab toolbar, tab-specific icons appear on hover.
**Keyboard Shortcut:** Shift+click to select multiple tabs for split.
**Technical Notes:** Integrates with Tab Islands. Each panel maintains independent navigation. "Disconnect from Split Screen" via right-click removes a single page.
**Zerant Relevance:** **HIGH** — Multi-pane browsing is a core differentiator for power users.

### 1.4 Tab Emojis
**Category:** Tab Personalization
**Description:** Assign emoji icons to individual tabs for visual identification. Hover over any tab to reveal an emoji selector; click "+" to access the full emoji suite.

**Visual Design:** Highlight brightness correlates with usage recency. Activates automatically with 8+ open tabs.

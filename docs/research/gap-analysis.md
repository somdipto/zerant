---

## Executive Summary

Since the original gap analysis (Feb 2026, v0.15.1), Zerant has grown from 380+ features to v0.70.0 with 231 MCP tools, 57 source modules, and 19 API route files. Several HIGH priority gaps have been closed:

### What's Been Built Since Feb 2026

| Feature | Was | Now | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Sidebar Chat Clients** | ❌ Missing | ✅ Complete | WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Instagram, X, Gmail, Calendar |
| **Pinboards** | ❌ Missing | ✅ Complete | Full CRUD, link/image/text/quote cards, layouts, themes, emoji badges |
| **Workspaces UI** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete | AI workspaces with visual switching, emoji icons, persistence |
| **Tracker Blocker** | ⚠️ Detect only | ✅ Active blocking | Blocklist support, domain allowlist, request interception |
| **Paste Protection** | ❌ Missing | ✅ Implemented | Clipboard manager with read/write monitoring |
| **Tab Groups** | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Better | TabGroup model with names/colors, but no auto-grouping or collapsible UI |

### New Capabilities Not in Original Analysis

| Feature | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Injection Guard** | v0.65.0 | 40+ detection patterns, hidden text detection, risk scoring (0-100) |
| **AI Workspaces** | v0.67.0 | Dedicated agent workspace isolation with full lifecycle |
| **Awareness Tools** | v0.70.0 | `tandem_awareness_digest` + `tandem_awareness_focus` for agent context |
| **Native Voice-to-Text** | v0.62.0 | Apple Speech API (macOS), Whisper fallback |
| **231 MCP Tools** | v0.69.0 | Full parity with HTTP API, 32 modular tool files |
| **Chrome Import Suite** | v0.69.0 | Profiles, bookmarks, history, cookies, continuous sync |
| **Extension Gallery** | v0.69.0 | Update management, conflict detection, disk usage tracking |
| **Live Preview System** | — | HTML preview create/update/list/delete |
| **DevTools Protocol** | — | Network HAR, console, DOM query, performance, storage via API |
| **Video Recording** | — | Screen/audio capture with MP4/WebM export |

### Current Score

- **19 features** Opera has that Zerant **also has** (✅) — unchanged
- **12 features** Opera has that Zerant **partially has** (⚠️) — was 17, improved
- **19 features** Opera has that Zerant **is missing** (❌) — was 29, many built
- **5 features** excluded per Robin's preferences

**The remaining pattern:** The consumer UX gap has narrowed significantly. Sidebar messengers and Pinboards — the two hardest items — are done. What remains is mostly **tab organization polish** (Islands, Split Screen, Search in Tabs), **consumer privacy UX** (ad blocker UI, private browsing window), and **lifestyle features** (battery saver, translate, themes).

### Updated Top 10 Remaining Features to Build

| # | Feature | Why | Effort |

| 1 | **Tab Islands** (upgrade) | Auto-grouping, collapsing, naming — infrastructure exists but no UX | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 2 | **Split Screen** | Multi-pane browsing — still completely missing | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 3 | **Ad Blocker** (consumer) | EasyList filter support — NetworkShield blocks threats, not ads | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 4 | **Search in Tabs** | Ctrl+Space tab search popup — API exists, no UI | Easy (1-2 days) |
| 5 | **Tab Snoozing** | Auto-suspend inactive tabs for memory savings | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 6 | **Private Browsing Window** | Cmd+Shift+N ephemeral window — session isolation exists, no UX | Easy (1-2 days) |

| 8 | **Security Badges** | Visual indicators in address bar | Easy (1-2 days) |
| 9 | **Speed Dial** (configurable) | Customizable start page tiles with folders | Medium (3-5 days) |
